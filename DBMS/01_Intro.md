-  **Drawbacks**
     - Data Redundancy (same data stored at different locations)
     - Data Inconsistency (different data visible in differnt parts belonging to same entity)
     - Difficult to access data
     - Data isolation
     - Atomicity problems
     - Security problems
     - Integrity problems
     - Concurrent-access anomalies

### Important terms
- Data Redundancy
   - unnecessary duplication of data in the database
   - example: storing customer name in multiple tables
