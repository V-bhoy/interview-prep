## What are hooks?
- special functions provided by React that allow functional components to manage its own state, lifecycle and other features.
- Before hooks, the functional components were stateless and were only used for rendering.

## What is useState hook?
- it allows functional components to manage state by declaring state variables, and provide a function to update them.
```
const [stateVariable, setStateFunction] = useState(initialValue);
â€¢	stateVariable â†’ holds the current value of the state.
â€¢	setStateFunction â†’ updates that value.
â€¢	initialValue â†’ the starting value of your state (can be number, string, object, array, etc.).
```
- Even when a component re-renders, React keeps the state value internally.
- Every time you call setState, React re-renders the component with the new value.
- Do not mutate state directly
```
count = count + 1;  // wonâ€™t re-render
setCount(count + 1);  // triggers re-render
```
- You can have multiple useState hooks in one component.
```
function Form() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [age, setAge] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <input onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} placeholder="Name" />
      <input onChange={e => setAge(e.target.value)} placeholder="Age" />
      <p>Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
- If your new state depends on the previous one, update the state using a callback function in the setState as it always points to the latest value of the state variable to avoid any race conditions
```
setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
```
## What is use effect hook?
- it is used to perform side effects in functional components like -
   - fetching data from API.
   - subscribing to events.
   - setting up timers
   - manually manipulating the DOM.
- Before hooks, these were handled by lifecycle methods in class components (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount).
useEffect unifies all of these in functional components.
```
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect logic
  return () => {
    // Cleanup (optional)
  };
}, [dependencies]);
Effect function â†’ first argument, runs after first render
Cleanup function â†’ optional, runs before unmounting or before the next effect
Dependency array â†’ second argument, controls when the effect runs
no array â†’ run after every render (not recommended)
```
- Component Did Mount (Run once)
```
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component mounted");
  }, []); // empty array â†’ runs only once

  return <h1>Hello, Vaishali ðŸ‘‹</h1>;
}
```
- Component Did Update (Run on state/prop change)
```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Count changed:", count);
  }, [count]); // runs every time 'count' changes

  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```
- Example 3: Cleanup (like componentWillUnmount)
```
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    console.log("Tick");
  }, 1000);

  return () => clearInterval(timer); // cleanup on unmount
}, []);
```
